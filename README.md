# Deltamethrin-Average-Velocity-Calculation
Code for Average Velocity Calculation in ‘A Faster-acting Deltamethrin Crystal Polymorph for Malaria Control’ by Yang et al.
Code Files:
velocity_calculation.m calcualtes the average velocity of insects in each Petri dish, and output the velocity-time data as MATLAB data file.
Plot_bioassay_data.m plots the velocity-time curves based on the velocity-time data calculated by velocity_calculation.m and KT(knochdown time)-mortality curves.

Data Files:
D. melanogaster_DMdusts_velocity.mat were velocity-time data calclated by velocity_calculation.m based on the bioassay videos of female fruit flies (D. melanogaster) exposed to DM Form I and II dusts.
D. melanogaster_DMdusts KT.xlsx were KT(knochdown time)-mortality data for female fruit flies (D. melanogaster) exposed to DM Form I and II dusts. The knockdown time was measured for each insect manually.
